I created this practice project with a few features I had not fully or ever implemented before, including all functional components and hooks and get requests made with axios. I styled with a combination of Semantic UI and styled-components. I really struggled to hide my api key for deployment, trying a number of things with both Heroku and Netlify. Making sure I have that down in the future is another project in itself. Thanks for taking a look!
